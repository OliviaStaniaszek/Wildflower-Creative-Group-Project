## Final prototypes

## visualisation.pde
Prototype showing how the user would navigate our program and the visual style
**map screen**
- click filter buttons to filter out areas with those conditions
- simple flowers shown in areas to show rough number of flowers planted in that area
- hover over a green space to highlight it
- click on a green space to view it close up
**green space screen**
- quantity of flowers based on how many flowers were planted in that area
- 'health bars' in the bottom right show the conditions of that area
- condition of area also show in the flowers 
    open/ closed petals -> sunny/shady area
    big/ crumpled leaves -> high/low soil moisture
    blue/green/yellow stem -> alkaline/neutral/acidic soil
- click 'plant here' to go to the confirmation screen, this adds a new flower to the visualisation

## sketch_3d_map.pde
Prototype showing 3D map functionality. Ideally we would like the user to be able to traverse the 3D map, populated with flowers as in the green space screen in visualisation.pde. 
- 3D map made in Blender
- imported into processing as multiple objects
- uses PeasyCam library
- controls:
    works best with mouse
    left click drag to rotate camera
    right click drag/ scroll wheel to zoom
    middle drag to pan
    double click to reset
    shift key to rotate/pan on one axis

With no limit on money or time, we would like to implement the functionality of the 3D map with the style and colours of the 2D visualisation
